## 📋 Requirements

- You'll need to have **[Python](https://www.python.org)** installed.

## 📝 How to use

- Download the repository archive (.zip) and extract it or use `git`.

```shell
git clone https://github.com/nik-lmao/discord-token-checker
```

- Install the requirements and run the script.

```shell
# Enter the repo directory
cd discord-token-checker

> [!NOTE]  
> If you check too many tokens at once, you might get ratelimited. You'll have to wait a few minutes to be able to send requests to discord's API again.
