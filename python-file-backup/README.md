# 🗂️ |  Python File Backup

This is a simple Python program that automatically saves your edited files to a backup folder.

## 📋 Requirements

- You'll need to have **[Python](https://www.python.org)** installed.

## 📝 How to use

- Download the repository archive (.zip) and extract it or use `git`.

```shell
git clone https://github.com/nik-lmao/python-file-backup
```

- Install the requirements and run the script.

```shell
# Enter the repo directory
cd python-file-backup

# Install requirements
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Don't forget to edit the variables in the python file!

# Run the python file
python main.py
```

Instead of installing the requirements manually via. shell you can also just run the start.bat file to automatically install all requirements and open the python script.

> [!NOTE]  
> The first time you use this it can take a while for the files to backup. That's because every file is being copied to the destination folder.
